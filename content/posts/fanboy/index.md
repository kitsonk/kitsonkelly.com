I got to be a fanboy this week.

It isn't often that you get to meet someone who has their own
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg). Let alone
someone who had tangentially had a huge influence in your life. Anders has lived
his life blissfully unaware of the impact he has had on mine.

For those who don't know, Anders is _Technical Fellow_ at Microsoft and is the
architect of many modern programming languages.

Our _relationship_ started in High School, where I learned
[Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) which continued into
the semester at
[Glendale Community College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale_Community_College_%28Arizona%29).
Of all the strange coincidences, a few days before my fanboy day, I met up with
an old High School friend who handed me over my course work from that first
semester at GCC. 26 years earlier, while he and his brother were away at
University, I was still keeping in touch with his parents. I must have dropped
by to say hello and left my homework. Jon's mom had held onto the work for 26
years, just in case I needed it! That was a sweet and lovely surprise as it was,
and strangely meaningful in knowing I was might meet Anders in a few days.

_Turbo Pascal_ and more so
[Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)) had a huge
impact on my life. In fact, my hobbyist interest in _Delphi_ led to my husband
picking up the language. That led him to a job in 2003 that was still apart of
our lives for the next 15 years.

Recently, my life has been ensconced in
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), being the project lead for
[Dojo 2](https://dojo.io/) where we are building a framework that will make it
easier and better to build enterprise web applications. When I found out that
Anders was the language architect behind _TypeScript_, I was amazed. I had
skipped out on his 3rd substantial language
([C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29)), but it
was clearly an important language. _TypeScript_ is quickly becoming a hugely
important language, and has become core to my day job.

We, [SitePen](https://www.sitepen.com/), have been dealing with _TypeScript_ for
a few years now, and with our usage on _Dojo 2_, we suggested to the
_TypeScript_ team at Microsoft that we should meet up. The team there was more
than receptive, so on this trip to visit my family, Dylan, our CEO, and myself
headed up to Redmond. While I didn't necessarily expect my _hero_ to be there, I
was hopeful.

I have been lucky in my life to meet important and famous people before, so I
sort of felt I could control my inner nerd enough to not faint or drool on
myself. I know Anders is just a man, with a job, who is hugely passionate about
solving computer language problems, and sure enough, that is the person I met.
Outside of my fanboy picture, we had a great discussion with the whole of the
TypeScript team, who are an awesome group of people. The problems the TypeScript
team and Anders are solving are different than the types of problems that we try
to solve at SitePen and with Dojo 2. While somewhat related, we had a great time
talking about what is different for each set of those problems. I know I
appreciated better the problems with languages and type systems and I think the
TypeScript team had better insight into the sorts of problems that are faced
enabling people to build better web applications.

This week has reminded me though how interconnected our world and lives are,
even when we are totally unaware of those connections, or the influence our
lives have on each other.
