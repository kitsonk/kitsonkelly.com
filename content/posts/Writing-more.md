I am going to try to commit to writing and blogging a bit more.  I have had a lot of thoughts bouncing around, and like a lot of things, you get better with practice.  So I have converted my homepage over to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) which is some of the nicest content management software I have ever worked with.  In addition I am using [Now Zeit](https://zeit.co/now) to deploy and host this site.
